My simple configuration files for awesome window manager


This is a simple and modular AwesomeWM configuration that I came up with. Some of the features include kawase blur support, rounded corner support, shadows, custom Discord, Spotify, and Firefox (all clean and including blur, of course), dmenu, useless gaps, randomized wallpapers, and more. 

The necessary dependencies include awesomewm-git (obviously), dmenu, pfetch, neovim, feh, and picom-ibhagwan-git.

Optional dependencies are Spicetify, BetterDiscord, Alacritty, tty-clock, cava, and bonsai.sh.

In order to set up everything like I have:
1. Clone the repo into your home directory
2. Copy rc.lua and theme.lua to ~/.config/awesome (create the directory if you don't have it)
3. Replace your current picom.conf with the one I have (located at ~/.config/picom.conf)
4. Copy my alacritty.yml into ~/.config/alacritty (again create it if you don't have it already)
5. Copy the BetterDiscord plugins and themes into your BetterDiscord directory (~/.config/BetterDiscord)
6. Copy the spicetify themes and extensions into your spicetify directory (~/.config/spicetify)
7. Refresh AwesomeWM with Super+Control+R
8. Enjoy

Feel free to modify anything to your liking.
